            <strong>Investing Beyond the Norm: Understanding the Risks of Alternative Asset Classes</strong>
        </h1>
        <p>Alternative assets are a type of investment that can offer potentially higher returns compared to traditional
            investments such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. However, these investments also carry a higher level of
            risk
            due to their less regulated nature and lack of liquidity. It is important to note that past performance is
            not
            indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee of profits or protection against losses.
        </p>
        <p>Investors are informed to carefully read the risk disclosures before making any investment decisions.
            Investors are
            also informed that Blue Featherâ€™s (FreeU) Risk Disclosure policy may not contain all possible risks that can
            arise
            from investment objectives, investment strategies and asset allocations. Hence, the risks in the disclosure
            are just
            estimates, and can differ from what actually occurs. In the light of the risks involved, investors should
            undertake
            transactions only if they understand the nature of the relationship into which they are entering, and the
            extent of
            their exposure to risk. No consideration should be made without thoroughly understanding and reviewing the
            risks
            involved. If you are unsure, you must seek professional advice on the same.
        </p>
        <p>Investors who are considering investing in alternative assets should have a high-risk tolerance and be
            prepared to
            accept potential losses. It is recommended that investors carefully review all available information
            regarding an
            investment before making a decision to invest. This includes reviewing the offering documents, the
            investment
            manager's track record, and any associated risks. Investors are advised to carefully review the disclosure
            papers,
            agreements, investment documents, and other related credentials carefully and consult their legal, tax and
            financial
            advisors, if they want, to determine any possible legal, tax and financial or any other consequences of
            investing
            before making any final investment decisions.
        </p>
        <p>Investors who choose to invest in alternative assets should be aware of the following risks:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> The value of alternative assets can be affected by various factors,
                including
                changes in interest rates, geopolitical events, and economic conditions. These factors can result in
                price
                volatility and may cause the value of the investment to decrease significantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Alternative assets can be illiquid, meaning they cannot be easily sold
                or
                converted to cash. As a result, investors may not be able to sell their investment when they need to or
                may have
                to sell it at a loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Risk:</strong> Alternative assets are often issued by smaller or less established
                companies,
                which may have a higher risk of defaulting on their obligations. This can result in a total loss of the
                investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Risk:</strong> Alternative assets may be managed by investment managers with limited
                experience, which can result in poor investment decisions or mismanagement of funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Alternative assets are often subject to less regulation than
                traditional
                investments, which can lead to higher risks for investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Concentration Risk:</strong> Some alternative assets may be highly concentrated in a single
                sector or
                asset class, which can increase the risk of losses if that sector or asset class experiences a downturn.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Complexity Risk:</strong> Some alternative assets may be highly complex, with unique features or
                structures that are difficult to understand. This can increase the risk of misunderstandings or
                misinterpretations of the investment's features or risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Counterparty Risk:</strong> Some alternative assets may involve counterparties or third-party
                service
                providers that are subject to their own risks, such as bankruptcy, fraud, or operational failures. This
                can
                result in losses to the investor.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax and Legal Risk:</strong> Alternative assets may be subject to unique tax or legal
                requirements,
                which can be complex and subject to change. This can result in unexpected tax liabilities or legal
                risks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Apart from the risks mentioned above, other risks or uncertainties include, but are not limited to, exposure
            to
            market risks, general economic and political conditions in other countries, the monetary and interest
            policies of
            India, inflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, the
            performance
            of the financial markets in India and globally, changes in domestic and foreign laws, regulations and taxes
            and
            changes in competition in the industry. While risk cannot be totally eliminated, it can be mitigated through
            a
            well-designed investment strategy.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that this policy is not exhaustive and does not cover all the risks associated with alternative
            assets.
            Investors should consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The goal
